# C++ Programming Project 1

This project is to examine the understanding of Data Structures and Patterns in both design and implementation on an actual application.

The required concepts are:
* Object-Oriented Programming:
  * Inheritance and Derived Classes
  * Friend Operator Overloading
  * Polymorphism
* Composite Data Structures:
  * Struct
  * Array
  * Singly Linked-List
  * Doubly Linked -List
* Abstract Data Type:
  * Stack
* Design Patterns:
  * Iterator
  * Prototype

This software prototype application is a Text-Based Game, player can interact with the system via Text
Input through the Command Line Interface. The name of the game is called “The Adventure”. The goal
of the game is a player keeps killing the enemies until it defeats the final boss. The game ends when
either the player defeated the final boss, or the enemy kill the player. When a player first enters the
game, hit points is set to 100 and weapon is “Hoe”.

This project is only for assignment purpose.
